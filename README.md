1. Hardware Drivers (Driver Modules)
Definition: In PLC systems, hardware drivers are specialized modules used to perform input and output operations. These modules enable the PLC to receive or send digital or analog signals.

Examples of Types:

Input Modules: Modules that transmit signals from sensors to the PLC.
Output Modules: Modules that control actuators such as motors and valves.
Analog Modules: Used to process continuously changing signals (e.g., temperature or pressure sensors).
